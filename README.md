#ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project is a responsive, interactive, and visually enhanced E-Learning Platform Front-End developed using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to showcase a clean, modular interface for an online learning portal and simulates essential user interactions such as login, course browsing, progress tracking, and engaging with embedded video courses. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the structure and UI of a multi-page e-learning web application focused entirely on front-end technologies, following strict requirements.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Multi-Page Interface
The platform is divided into several structured pages including:

Home Page (index.html) â€” introduces the platform and links to main sections.

Courses Page (courses.html) â€” displays a list of available courses in card format.

Progress Page (progress.html) â€” simulates user progress through course listings.

Login Page (login.html) â€” enables basic login simulation using front-end logic.

Dashboard Page (dashboard.html) â€” post-login landing page with course access.

Course Detail Page (course-detail.html) â€” contains embedded video lessons and quizzes.

Course Listing
Courses are displayed as individual cards with visual styling and animations. Each course includes a title, brief description, and a video preview. A filter mechanism is also integrated, allowing users to view beginner, intermediate, or all-level courses.

Video Embedding
Each course has an associated video that is embedded directly into the detail page. This enhances user engagement by simulating the experience of attending an online lecture or tutorial.

Progress Tracking (Mock UI)
While this project does not include a backend database or local storage, a mock Progress page shows how a user might visualize their completion percentage or enrolled courses. The design focuses on representing data in a clean, digestible format.

Interactive Quiz Module
The Course Detail page features a simple quiz below each video to test the learnerâ€™s understanding. Each quiz dynamically loads based on the selected course and provides immediate feedback for correct or incorrect answers.

Authentication Flow (Front-End Only)
A login page with basic form handling has been implemented. Though there is no backend authentication, the flow simulates a user session and redirects to the Dashboard upon successful form submission.

Dark Mode Toggle
A theme toggle switch is included in the header of every page to allow users to switch between light and dark modes. This enhances accessibility and improves user comfort.

Responsive and Accessible Design
The UI is fully responsive across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Fonts, buttons, and layouts adapt gracefully to different screen sizes while maintaining usability.

Smooth Animations
Subtle animations such as fade-in transitions have been added to improve the user experience and make the interface feel more dynamic and polished.
